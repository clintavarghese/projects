## I. Introduction

This project is inspired from popular [CityNerd](https://www.youtube.com/@CityNerd) Youtube channel's presentation on [*Farebox Recovery*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl7cprP_6KM). The main goal of this mini project is to explore, analyze, and interpret transit data from various sources to derive insights into ridership trends, agency performance, and the financial efficiency of transit systems for the year 2022.

The primary source of data is from [National Transit Database](https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd)

The datasets used in this analysis is from

-   The [2022 Annual Database Fare Revenues](https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2022-annual-database-fare-revenues) table

-   The latest [Monthly Ridership](https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/monthly-module-adjusted-data-release) tables

-   The [2022 Operating Expenses](https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2022-operating-expenses) reports

The analysis primarily focuses on key financial and operational performance metrics, such as Vehicle Revenue Miles (VRM), Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT), and Farebox Recovery Ratio (the ratio of total fares to expenses). Additional explorations focus on the most efficient transit modes and the busiest metropolitan areas.

## II. Data Preparation

### Loading Required Libraries

To begin, we load the necessary R libraries, primarily using the `tidyverse` package for data wrangling and `DT` for data visualization.

```{r}
#|warning: false
#|message: false

if (!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
if (!require("DT")) install.packages("DT")
library(tidyverse)
library(DT)
```

### Importing Datasets

We imported three main datasets: Fare Revenue (`FARES`), Operating Expenses (`EXPENSES`), and Ridership Data (`TRIPS`, `MILES`). These were cleaned and filtered to remove irrelevant columns, resulting in a dataset that focuses on total fares, expenses, and VRM/UPT data.

```{r}
#|warning: false
#|message: false
#|results: hide
FARES <- readxl::read_xlsx("MP-DATA/2022 Fare Revenue.xlsx")
EXPENSES <- readr::read_csv("MP-DATA/2022_NTD_Annual_Data_-_Operating_Expenses__by_Function__20231102.csv")
TRIPS <- readxl::read_xlsx("MP-DATA/July 2024 Complete Monthly Ridership (with adjustments and estimates)_240903.xlsx", sheet="UPT")
MILES <- readxl::read_xlsx("MP-DATA/July 2024 Complete Monthly Ridership (with adjustments and estimates)_240903.xlsx", sheet="VRM")
```

### Data Cleaning

After importing the data, several unnecessary columns were dropped to keep the datasets focused on the required metrics (UPT, VRM, Expenses, etc.)

To extract monthly financials such as Total Fares and Expenses for each mode, A new dataset (`FINANCIALS`) is created by joining Fare Revenue (`FARES`), Operating Expenses (`EXPENSES`). It contains (`NTD ID`, `Agency Name` , `Mode`, `Total Fares`, `Expenses`)

```{r,results = 'hide',warning=FALSE}
#|warning: false
#|message: false
#|results: hide

FARES <- FARES|>
    select(-`State/Parent NTD ID`, 
           -`Reporter Type`,
           -`Reporting Module`,
           -`TOS`,
           -`Passenger Paid Fares`,
           -`Organization Paid Fares`) |>
    filter(`Expense Type` == "Funds Earned During Period") |>
    select(-`Expense Type`) |>
    group_by(`NTD ID`,       # Sum over different `TOS` for the same `Mode`
             `Agency Name`,  # These are direct operated and sub-contracted 
             `Mode`) |>      # of the same transit modality
                             # Not a big effect in most munis (significant DO
                             # tends to get rid of sub-contractors), but we'll sum
                             # to unify different passenger experiences
    summarize(`Total Fares` = sum(`Total Fares`)) |>
    ungroup()

EXPENSES<- EXPENSES|>
    select(`NTD ID`, 
           `Agency`,
           `Total`, 
           `Mode`) |>
    mutate(`NTD ID` = as.integer(`NTD ID`)) |>
    rename(Expenses = Total) |>
    group_by(`NTD ID`, `Mode`) |>
    summarize(Expenses = sum(Expenses)) |>
    ungroup()

FINANCIALS <- inner_join(FARES, EXPENSES, join_by(`NTD ID`, `Mode`))
```

Similarly to extract monthly transits numbers such as Unlinked Passenger Trip and Vehicle Revenue Miles for each agency and mode, a new data set USAGE(`USAGE`) is created by joining TRIPS (`TRIPS`) and MILES (`MILES`). It contains (`NTD ID`,`Agency` ,`UZA Name`,`Mode`,`3 Mode`,`month`,`UPT`, `VRM` )

```{r, results = 'hide',message=FALSE}
#|warning: false
#|message: false
#|results: hide
#|
TRIPS <- TRIPS |>
            filter(`Mode/Type of Service Status` == "Active") |>
            select(-`Legacy NTD ID`, 
                   -`Reporter Type`, 
                   -`Mode/Type of Service Status`, 
                   -`UACE CD`, 
                   -`TOS`) |>
            pivot_longer(-c(`NTD ID`:`3 Mode`), 
                            names_to="month", 
                            values_to="UPT") |>
            drop_na() |>
            mutate(month=my(month)) # Parse _m_onth _y_ear date specs
MILES <- MILES |>
            filter(`Mode/Type of Service Status` == "Active") |>
            select(-`Legacy NTD ID`, 
                   -`Reporter Type`, 
                   -`Mode/Type of Service Status`, 
                   -`UACE CD`, 
                   -`TOS`) |>
            pivot_longer(-c(`NTD ID`:`3 Mode`), 
                            names_to="month", 
                            values_to="VRM") |>
            drop_na() |>
            group_by(`NTD ID`, `Agency`, `UZA Name`, 
                     `Mode`, `3 Mode`, month) |>
            summarize(VRM = sum(VRM)) |>
            ungroup() |>
            mutate(month=my(month)) # Parse _m_onth _y_ear date specs

USAGE <- inner_join(TRIPS, MILES) |>
    mutate(`NTD ID` = as.integer(`NTD ID`))
```

## III. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Sampling and Displaying Data

#### *USAGE*

The str(`str`) function is used to get an overview of the datatypes.

```{r}
str(USAGE)
```

For easier readability, the column names are renamed, for ex: `UZA Name` can be renamed as `metro_area`. I have decided to keep UPT and VRM as is since its harder to rename with its full abbreviation.

##### Task 1

::: callout
##### Creating Syntatic Names

Rename a column: `UZA Name` to `metro_area`.

```{r}
USAGE <- rename(USAGE, 
               metro_area = `UZA Name`
               )
```
:::

##### TASK 2

::: callout
##### Recoding the `Mode` column

The details for what each Mode represents were found in [National Transit Database (NTD) Glossary](https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/national-transit-database-ntd-glossary)

```{r}
USAGE <- USAGE |>
    mutate(Mode = case_when(
        Mode == "AR" ~ "Alaska Rail",
        Mode == "CB" ~ "Commuter Bus",
        Mode == "CC" ~ "Cable Car",
        Mode == "CR" ~ "Commuter Rail",
        Mode == "DR" ~ "Demand Response",
        Mode == "FB" ~ "Ferryboat",
        Mode == "HR" ~ "Heavy Rail",
        Mode == "IP" ~ "Inclined Plane",
        Mode == "LR" ~ "Light Rail",
        Mode == "MB" ~ "Motor Bus",
        Mode == "MG" ~ "Monorail/Automated Guideway",
        Mode == "PB" ~ "Publico",
        Mode == "RB" ~ "Bus Rapid Transit",
        Mode == "SR" ~ "Streetcar Rail ",
        Mode == "TB" ~ "Trolleybus ",
        Mode == "TR" ~ "Aerial Tramway",
        Mode == "VP" ~ "Vanpool",
        Mode == "YR" ~ "Hybrid Rail",
        TRUE ~ "Unknown"
    ))
```
:::

To get an overview of the ridership data (`USAGE`), we sampled 1000 records and displayed them using an interactive datatable.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
sample_n(USAGE,100)|> DT::datatable()
```

#### *FINANCIALS*

```{r}
str(FINANCIALS)
```

For easier readability the `Mode` is recoded

```{r,echo=FALSE}
FINANCIALS <-FINANCIALS |>
    mutate(Mode = case_when(
        Mode == "AR" ~ "Alaska Rail",
        Mode == "CB" ~ "Commuter Bus",
        Mode == "CC" ~ "Cable Car",
        Mode == "CR" ~ "Commuter Rail",
        Mode == "DR" ~ "Demand Response",
        Mode == "FB" ~ "Ferryboat",
        Mode == "HR" ~ "Heavy Rail",
        Mode == "IP" ~ "Inclined Plane",
        Mode == "LR" ~ "Light Rail",
        Mode == "MB" ~ "Motor Bus",
        Mode == "MG" ~ "Monorail/Automated Guideway",
        Mode == "PB" ~ "Publico",
        Mode == "RB" ~ "Bus Rapid Transit",
        Mode == "SR" ~ "Streetcar Rail ",
        Mode == "TB" ~ "Trolleybus ",
        Mode == "TR" ~ "Aerial Tramway",
        Mode == "VP" ~ "Vanpool",
        Mode == "YR" ~ "Hybrid Rail",
        TRUE ~ "Unknown"
    ))
```

Here is the overview of the ridership data (`FINANCIALS`),

```{r}
FINANCIALS |>  DT::datatable()
```

##### Task 4

::: callout
##### Answering Instructor Specified Questions with `dplyr`.

**A.Vehicle Revenue Miles (VRM) Analysis**\

`VRM` refers to *Vehicle Revenue Miles*.

It is the miles that vehicles are scheduled to or actually travel while in revenue service. (total number of miles traveled by a vehicle while it is in service and generating revenue by transporting passengers. It is used in public transportation and transit systems to measure the productive service a vehicle provides.)

Vehicle revenue miles include: *Layover / recovery time*\
Vehicle revenue miles exclude: *Deadhead, Operator training,Vehicle maintenance testing, and Other non-revenue uses of vehicles.*

> **1.Which transit agency had the most total VRM?**\

```{r, results = 'hide'}

}
```

> > By summarizing VRM across transit agencies from `2002 to 2024`, (I created a function named table_creation to tables)

```{r}
table_creation(
  USAGE %>%
    group_by(Agency) %>%
    summarise(`total_VRM($/miles)` = sum(VRM)) %>%
    arrange(desc(`total_VRM($/miles)`)) %>%
    slice(1:3))
```

The transit agency with the highest VRM in the sample is identified as

`Agency`: `MTA New York City Transit` with `Total_VRM`: `10.83 billion revenue miles`

> **2.Which transit mode had the most total VRM?**\
> Similarly, the analysis was performed by transit mode and arranged in descending order.

```{r}
table_creation(USAGE %>%
  group_by(Mode) %>%
  summarise(`total_VRM($/miles)` = sum(VRM)) %>%
  arrange(desc(`total_VRM($/miles)`) )|> slice(1:3))
```

The transist Mode (`Motor Bus`) had the total VRM of (`49.45 billion revenue miles`)

> **3.NYC Subway Ridership in May 2024**\
> To analyze ridership on the NYC Subway, we filtered the data for `Heavy Rail` in May 2024 and retrieved UPT values:

```{r}
table_creation(USAGE %>%
  filter(Mode == 'Heavy Rail' & str_detect(Agency, "New York City") & month == "2024-05-01") %>%
  select(Mode,UPT))
```

The monthly ridership of subway for month of May 2025 is total UPT of (`180.46 million`)\

> **4.NYC Subway Ridership Decline from April 2019 to April 2020**\
> A significant decline in ridership was observed between April 2019 and April 2020. The percentage decline was calculated, and the ridership trend was plotted:

```{r}
#|warning: false
#|message: false
#|results: hide

NYC_subway <- USAGE %>%
  filter(month>="2019-04-01", month <= "2024-04-01", , Mode == 'Heavy Rail' & str_detect(Agency, "New York City"))

# Calculate the percentage decline from April 2019 to April 2020
start_value <- NYC_subway %>% filter(month == "2019-04-01") %>% pull(UPT)
end_value <- NYC_subway %>% filter(month == "2020-04-01") %>% pull(UPT)
decline_percentage <- ((start_value - end_value) / start_value) * 100

# Create the plot
ggplot(NYC_subway, aes(month, UPT / 1000000)) +
  geom_line(color="blue") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(title = paste("NYC Subway Ridership Data (April 2019 - April 2024)\nDecline: ",
                     round(decline_percentage, 2), "% from (04/2019-04/2020)"),  # Display decline percentage in title
       x = "timeline",
       y = "UPT (Unlinked Passenger Trips) in Millions") +
  theme_minimal()


```

The subway system experienced a **91.28% decline** in ridership between April 2019 and April 2020.\
However, post-pandemic, ridership has been steadily increasing.However,with the rise of hybrid work culture, monthly UPT rides now show a fluctuating, zigzag pattern.

```{r}
table_creation(USAGE |>group_by(metro_area)|>

arrange(desc(`number of agencies`)) |>
slice(1:5))
```

There are 38 agencies operating in the NY–Jersey City–Newark, NY–NJ metro area and 22 agencies in the Los Angeles–Long Beach, CA region. Let's focus on the NY–NJ area.

```{r}
#|warning: false

  summarize(
    total_VRM = sum(VRM, na.rm = TRUE), 
    total_UPT = sum(UPT, na.rm = TRUE), 
    
    ratio = if_else(total_VRM>0, total_VRM,NA_real_) / if_else(total_UPT > 0, total_UPT, NA_real_), .groups = 'drop'

```

Most agencies in NY-NJ Metro area offers `Bus` services. Lets see how is the presence of each mode with in Agencies.

ggplot(agency_modes_2023, aes(x = Mode, y = Agency)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Mode), size = 2)+  # Create a tile for each combination of mode and agency
  labs(title = "Presence of Transit Modes by Agency\n,

  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 0.75, color = "grey70"),  # Major grid lines
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(size = 0.5, color = "grey85"),  # Minor grid lines for a sharper effect
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank())

```

It's surprising to see that the `Vanpool` service is exclusively offered by NJT. Given the vastness of the NY-NJ metropolitan area, it would be beneficial to promote `Vanpool` services similar to how other major cities like the SF-LA area are doing.

> #3 Which Mode of transit achieved the highest Vehicle Revenue Miles (VRM) per trip each year.

The VRM per trip ratio provides valuable insights into agency efficiency. A lower ratio indicates higher vehicle utilization, meaning the agency is transporting more passengers per mile of service. Typically, urban areas tend to have lower VRM per trip ratios compared to rural areas.

To assess the efficiency of agencies in the NY–NJ metropolitan area, we calculated the ratio of VRM to Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT). This ratio reflects how well transit systems are utilizing their vehicles in relation to passenger demand, with a lower VRM/UPT ratio indicating better efficiency.

  summarize(mean_of_median = round(mean(median_ratio, na.rm = TRUE),2),no_agency=n(), .groups = 'drop')|>arrange(mean_of_median))  # Calculate mean of median ratios for each mode)
 

```

`Ferryboat` service and `heavy rail` service has the lowest VRM/UPT ratio after factoring no-agencies contributing to the data, This means those modes have better operational efficiency in terms of ridership relative to miles driven. Since there is only 1 agency contributing to the bus rapid transist, it is hard to determine its universality.

### Farebox Recovery and Cost Efficiency in Transit Systems

#### 1. **Transit System with the Highest Farebox Recovery For The Year 2022**

Farebox recovery is the ratio of Total Fares to Total Expenses, measuring how effectively fare revenue covers a transit system's operational costs. It's crucial for a transit agency to generate enough revenue from passengers to offset its operating expenses. A higher farebox recovery ratio reduces the agency's reliance on alternative funding sources to keep the transit system running.

```{r,warning=FALSE}
table_creation(USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS_top |> 
  group_by(Agency, Mode) |> 
  summarize(
    fare_box_ratio = round(ifelse(`Total Fares` > 0, `Total Fares`, NA_real_) / ifelse(Expenses > 0, Expenses, NA_real_),2
  )) |> 
  arrange(desc(fare_box_ratio)) |> 
  ungroup() |> 
  slice(1:5))
```

**Agency:** `Port Imperial Ferry Corporation`\
**Mode:** `Ferry Boat`\
**Farebox Recovery Ratio:** `1.43`

**Interesting Facts about Port Imperial Ferry’s Role**

In 2022, the system with the highest farebox recovery ratio was the Port Imperial Ferry Corporation.\

-   **Prime Location**: [Port Imperial terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Imperial), located in Weehawken, New Jersey, connects commuters from New Jersey’s Hudson River waterfront to key locations in Manhattan. It is a crucial transportation link, especially for daily commuters.\

-   **Intermodal Hub**: It is also part of an intermodal hub, with connections to New Jersey Transit’s Hudson-Bergen Light Rail. This makes it easier for commuters to switch transit modes, enhancing the system’s convenience.\

-   **Time-Saving Option**: Their primary customers are daily commuters as it is often faster than other transit modes during rush hours, avoiding heavy traffic on bridges and tunnels, making it a preferred option for those seeking efficiency.\

-   **Summary**: Port Imperial Ferry's high farebox recovery is driven by its limited competition, strategic docking agreements, loyal commuter base, and efficient cost management, allowing the service to generate significant revenue relative to its operational costs.\

#### 2. **Transit System with the Lowest Expenses per Unlinked Passenger Trip (UPT)**

Expenses per UPT measure the cost efficiency of a transit system, indicating how much the agency spends to serve per unlinked passenger trip.

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
table_creation(USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS_top |> 
  group_by(Agency, Mode) |> 
  summarize(
    expenses_per_UPT = round(ifelse(Expenses > 0, Expenses, NA_real_) / total_UPT
  ,2)) |> 
  arrange(expenses_per_UPT) |> 
  ungroup() |> 
  slice(1:5))
```

**Agency:** `North Carolina State University`\
**Mode:** `Motor Bus`\
**Expenses per UPT:** `1.18 $/ride`\

##### Why NCSU's Motorbus System is Profitable?

-   **Campus Size**: North Carolina State University’s main campus spans over 2,000 acres. This vast area creates the need for an internal transportation network to efficiently connect different parts of the university.

-   **Transportation Master Plan**: NCSU has a well-structured [Transportation Master Plan](https://transportation.ncsu.edu/about-ncsu-transportation/) aimed at improving and optimizing its transportation network. This plan includes strategies to enhance route efficiency, reduce congestion, and ensure the system meets the growing demands of the campus population.

-   **Institutional Support and Subsidies**: NCSU likely subsidizes a portion of the motor bus system’s operating costs, which helps keep operational expenses lower. University funding or student fees may cover some costs, reducing the financial burden on passengers while keeping fares affordable, if not free.

**Agency:** `Metropolitan Transportation Commission`\
**Mode:** `Vanpool`\
**Expenses per VRM:** `0.445 $/mile`\
\*\*Metro-Area\*:\*\* `San Francisco--Oakland, CA`

The [Bay Area Vanpool Program](https://511.org/vanpool), managed by the MTC, supports groups of 7 to 15 commuters traveling together with an unpaid driver.\

According to the [Berkleyside](https://www.berkeleyside.org/2022/11/20/casual-carpool-bay-bridge-covid-traffi), Casual Carpool was a Bay Area tradition before COVID. Post Covid, longtime riders and drivers who want to revive casual carpool are finding it difficult to reestablish the famously organic tradition. But since many people are returning to work and seeking efficient ways to travel, and it’s interesting to observe that there’s a slow resurgence of this informal carpooling tradition.

##### Why MTC'S Vanpool reduce expenses per Vehicle Revenue Mile (VRM)?

-   **Cost-Effective Commute** : Vanpooling is often more economical than driving alone, with participants sharing the costs of fuel, tolls, and maintenance. This can lead to significant savings for commuters.\

-   **Sustainable Way** : By reducing the number of single-occupancy vehicles on the road, vanpools help decrease traffic congestion and lower greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to a more sustainable environment.\

-   **Vanpool Rewards** : The MTC actively promotes vanpooling as part of its broader strategy to enhance public transportation options and reduce reliance on individual car travel. Each counties provides different benefits including pre-tax benefits, discounted parking permits and subsidies for commuter vanpoolers\

## V. What do you believe to be the most efficient transit system in the country?

In my view, the most efficient transit system is one that prioritizes the needs of the community rather than focusing solely on generating revenue. Such a system aims to provide reliable and accessible transportation options that serve the public effectively. Among the various transit modes analyzed, I find `ferryboats` to be particularly efficient, especially in terms of their overall Vehicle Revenue Miles (VRM) to Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT) ratio. This efficiency indicates that ferryboats are capable of serving a substantial number of passengers relative to the distance traveled, making them a viable option for enhancing urban mobility.

Additionally, when considering cost-effectiveness and environmental sustainability, the `Vanpool` mode emerges as the best option. Vanpools not only reduce operational costs but also contribute positively to the environment by minimizing the number of individual vehicles on the road. By consolidating passengers into fewer vehicles, Vanpools can significantly decrease carbon emissions and traffic congestion, promoting a greener transit solution.

Ultimately, an efficient transit system should not merely aim for financial gain but should instead focus on fulfilling the transportation needs of its users while fostering sustainable practices. By investing in transit options like ferryboats and Vanpools, cities can create a more effective and environmentally friendly transportation network that benefits both the community and the planet.
