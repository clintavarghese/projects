I compared various allocation strategies, assessed fairness and proportionality, and created visualizations like red/blue electoral maps using data from the MIT Election Lab and the US Census Bureau’s TIGER repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project positioned me as a Hollywood development executive, analyzing large-scale IMDb data to pitch a new movie. I developed proficiency in handling large datasets and relational data structures through techniques like table joins, enhancing my skills in managing and interpreting extensive information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI investigate the fiscal characteristics of US public transit authorities. In this project, I handle the data import and tidying; students are mainly responsible for “single table” dplyr operations (mutate, group_by, summarize, select, arrange, rename) to produce summary statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this project, I conducted a comparative analysis of two CUNY retirement plans using Monte Carlo simulations. By incorporating historical financial and macroeconomic data, I assessed the probability of different retirement outcomes. This experience included working with APIs, implementing complex simulations, and applying bootstrap inference techniques to quantify prediction uncertainties."
