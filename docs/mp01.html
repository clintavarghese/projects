<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i.-introduction">I. Introduction</h2>
<p>This project is inspired from popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CityNerd">CityNerd</a> Youtube channelâ€™s presentation on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl7cprP_6KM"><em>Farebox Recovery</em></a>. The main goal of this mini project is to explore, analyze, and interpret transit data from various sources to derive insights into ridership trends, agency performance, and the financial efficiency of transit systems for the year 2022.</p>
<p>The primary source of data is from <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd">National Transit Database</a></p>
<p>The datasets used in this analysis is from</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2022-annual-database-fare-revenues">2022 Annual Database Fare Revenues</a> table</p></li>
<li><p>The latest <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/monthly-module-adjusted-data-release">Monthly Ridership</a> tables</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2022-operating-expenses">2022 Operating Expenses</a> reports</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The analysis primarily focuses on key financial and operational performance metrics, such as Vehicle Revenue Miles (VRM), Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT), and Farebox Recovery Ratio (the ratio of total fares to expenses). Additional explorations focus on the most efficient transit modes and the busiest metropolitan areas.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s surprising to see that the <code>Vanpool</code> service is exclusively offered by NJT. Given the vastness of the NY-NJ metropolitan area, it would be beneficial to promote <code>Vanpool</code> services similar to how other major cities like the SF-LA area are doing.</p>

<p>#3 Which Mode of transit achieved the highest Vehicle Revenue Miles (VRM) per trip each year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The VRM per trip ratio provides valuable insights into agency efficiency. A lower ratio indicates higher vehicle utilization, meaning the agency is transporting more passengers per mile of service. Typically, urban areas tend to have lower VRM per trip ratios compared to rural areas.</p>
<p>To assess the efficiency of agencies in the NYâ€“NJ metropolitan area, we calculated the ratio of VRM to Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT). This ratio reflects how well transit systems are utilizing their vehicles in relation to passenger demand, with a lower VRM/UPT ratio indicating better efficiency.</p>

<p><code>Ferryboat</code> service and <code>heavy rail</code> service has the lowest VRM/UPT ratio after factoring no-agencies contributing to the data, This means those modes have better operational efficiency in terms of ridership relative to miles driven. Since there is only 1 agency contributing to the bus rapid transist, it is hard to determine its universality.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transit-system-with-the-highest-farebox-recovery-for-the-year-2022">1. <strong>Transit System with the Highest Farebox Recovery For The Year 2022</strong></h4>
<p>Farebox recovery is the ratio of Total Fares to Total Expenses, measuring how effectively fare revenue covers a transit systemâ€™s operational costs. Itâ€™s crucial for a transit agency to generate enough revenue from passengers to offset its operating expenses. A higher farebox recovery ratio reduces the agencyâ€™s reliance on alternative funding sources to keep the transit system running.</p>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-ncsus-motorbus-system-is-profitable">Why NCSUâ€™s Motorbus System is Profitable?</h5>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Campus Size</strong>: North Carolina State Universityâ€™s main campus spans over 2,000 acres. This vast area creates the need for an internal transportation network to efficiently connect different parts of the university.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transportation Master Plan</strong>: NCSU has a well-structured <a href="https://transportation.ncsu.edu/about-ncsu-transportation/">Transportation Master Plan</a> aimed at improving and optimizing its transportation network. This plan includes strategies to enhance route efficiency, reduce congestion, and ensure the system meets the growing demands of the campus population.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Institutional Support and Subsidies</strong>: NCSU likely subsidizes a portion of the motor bus systemâ€™s operating costs, which helps keep operational expenses lower. University funding or student fees may cover some costs, reducing the financial burden on passengers while keeping fares affordable, if not free.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Ridership</strong>: With a high volume of students and staff commuting daily, the system benefits from economies of scale. High passenger volume distributes operational costs across more riders, making the cost per trip lower, and ensuring the bus system operates efficiently.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Focused Cost Management</strong>: NCSUâ€™s internal control over the transportation system allows for focused cost management. With optimized vehicle maintenance, route planning, and operational schedules, the motor bus system is kept cost-efficient, ensuring its financial sustainability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Summary</strong>: NCSUâ€™s motor bus system is profitable due to the combination of a large and spread-out campus, optimized and efficient route planning, institutional subsidies, and high ridership levels. This strategic approach, combined with NCSUâ€™s Transportation Master Plan, ensures that the system operates at a low cost, making it not only cost-efficient but also potentially profitable.</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="v.-what-do-you-believe-to-be-the-most-efficient-transit-system-in-the-country">V. What do you believe to be the most efficient transit system in the country?</h2>
<p>In my view, the most efficient transit system is one that prioritizes the needs of the community rather than focusing solely on generating revenue. Such a system aims to provide reliable and accessible transportation options that serve the public effectively. Among the various transit modes analyzed, I find <code>ferryboats</code> to be particularly efficient, especially in terms of their overall Vehicle Revenue Miles (VRM) to Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT) ratio. This efficiency indicates that ferryboats are capable of serving a substantial number of passengers relative to the distance traveled, making them a viable option for enhancing urban mobility.</p>
<p>Additionally, when considering cost-effectiveness and environmental sustainability, the <code>Vanpool</code> mode emerges as the best option. Vanpools not only reduce operational costs but also contribute positively to the environment by minimizing the number of individual vehicles on the road. By consolidating passengers into fewer vehicles, Vanpools can significantly decrease carbon emissions and traffic congestion, promoting a greener transit solution.</p>
<p>Ultimately, an efficient transit system should not merely aim for financial gain but should instead focus on fulfilling the transportation needs of its users while fostering sustainable practices. By investing in transit options like ferryboats and Vanpools, cities can create a more effective and environmentally friendly transportation network that benefits both the community and the planet.</p>
